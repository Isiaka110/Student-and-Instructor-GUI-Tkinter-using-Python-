# Student-and-Instructor-GUI-Tkinter-using-Python-
CSC 215-Python, Group 1 Project, to build a Graphical User Interface for Student and Instructors


**## Student-Instructor Platform**

This project provides a basic Python code for a student-instructor platform with two main sections:

* **Student:** Add student information (name, ID, matric number) and manage the list.
* **Instructor:** Login (currently with placeholder logic), view registered students, and manage the list.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3
* tkinter library (install with `pip install tkinter`)

**Running the code:**

1. **Clone or download the project.**
2. **Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.**
3. **Run the command:** `python student_instructor_platform.py`

**Using the application:**

**Student Section:**

* Enter student information and click "Submit Student Info" to add them to the list.
* Click "Clear" to erase entered information.
* Click "Go to Instructor Login Page" to switch sections.

**Instructor Section:**

* Enter your name and click "Login" (currently checks for "John Doe").
* View the list of registered students.
* Select a student and click "Delete Selected" to remove them.
* Click "Logout" to return to the Student page.

**Customization and improvements:**

* Modify the code to change styling, add features, and implement real authentication.
* Replace the placeholder "John Doe" login with a secure authentication system.

**Note:**

* This is a basic example and might require further modifications for specific needs.

**Additional files:**

* `student_instructor_platform.py`: The main Python code file.
